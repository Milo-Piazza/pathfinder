# Pathfinder
![Sample Path](/path_sample.png)  
Highlights the path your character will take to the hovered unobstructed tile. Ideal for situations like Zalcano (avoiding red symbols) and Gauntlet (avoiding tornadoes and stomps.)  

# Usage
Simply enable the plugin "Pathfinder" in your configuration tab. You can also configure the path display to switch on and off with a keybind (default Ctrl-Z on Windows, Cmd-Z on Mac.)
