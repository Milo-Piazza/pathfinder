# Pathfinder
![Sample Path](path_sample.png)  
Highlights the path your character will take to the hovered unobstructed tile. Ideal for situations like Zalcano (avoiding red symbols) and Gauntlet (avoiding tornadoes and stomps.)

![Path showing only tiles actually stood on](skip_tiles_sample.jpg)  
Also supports showing only tiles you actually stand on while running!

# Usage
Simply enable the plugin "Pathfinder" in your configuration tab. You can also configure the path display to switch on and off with a keybind (default Ctrl-Z on Windows, Cmd-Z on Mac.).
Check your settings to enable "skip jumped tiles" to only show tiles you touch while running.
